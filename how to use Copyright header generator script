Powershell – Copyright header generator script

1.	Create Copywright.ps file with the below contents:

param($target = "D:\\Babloo\\Workspace\\KRIS-COE\\BitBucketCode\\api-app-icam")

$header = "/*
*  (©) 2022 KPMG LLP,a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved
*/"

$headerForProperties = "#
#  (©) 2022 KPMG LLP,a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved
#"

function Write-Header ($file) {

    $content = Get-Content $file

    $filename = Split-Path -Leaf $file

    $fileheader = $header -f $filename
    Set-Content $file $fileheader

    Add-Content $file $content
}

function Write-Header-Properties ($file) {

    $content = Get-Content $file

    $filename = Split-Path -Leaf $file

    $fileheader = $headerForProperties -f $filename
    Set-Content $file $fileheader

    Add-Content $file $content
}

Get-ChildItem $target -Recurse | ? { $_.Extension -like ".java"}   | % {

    Write-Header $_.PSPath.Split(":",3)[2]
}
Get-ChildItem $target -Recurse | ? { $_.Extension -like ".properties"}   | % {

    Write-Header-Properties $_.PSPath.Split(":",3)[2]

}


NOTE : Change the path of your project according to your system :

param($target = "D:\\Babloo\\Workspace\\KRIS-COE\\BitBucketCode\\api-app-icam")


2.	In VS code while running the co-operate script it will give us the security violation issues. To counter that we must update setting.json with below configurations :

"terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
        "PowerShell": {
          "source": "PowerShell",
          "icon": "terminal-powershell",
          "args": ["-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass"]
        }
      }

3.	Now Open the PowerShell and execute the power shell script. Use following commands:

   .\Copyright.ps1 

Output :
Package level :
 

Class Level :

 

Properties Level :

 


NOTE :  While adding header to json file, we are violating the json formatter principal and it will get impact in our implemented code base and response structure.
